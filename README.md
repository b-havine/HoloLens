# HoloLens

This project is made by two internship students.

It's an alternative to a warehouse worker that either has to
put items om stock - or when the item has to be picked up for shipping.

In order to see the Solution Explorer of our architecture, you need to open the HoloLens.sln file
 in visual Studio the sln file is located at the root of the HoloLens folder.
 
 The version we have been working with is: 
 ### Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 15.8.8.
 
 
If the file cannot be opened, you will need to go into Microsoft Visual Installer:
## 1. click on modify
## 2. check if you have these workloads: 
  ### .NET desktop development
  ### Universal Windows Platform development
  ### Game Development with Unity
  
## 3. If any are missing, click on Modify.

We have been using the 3-layer arcitecture which is based on presentation - logic - persistence.
