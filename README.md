# HoloLens

This project is made by two internship students.

It's an alternative to a warehouse worker that either has to
put items om stock - or when the item has to be picked up for shipping.

In order to see the Solution Explorer of our architecture, you need to open the HoloLens.sln file
in the root of the HoloLens folder.

We have been using the 3-layer arcitecture which is based on presentation - logic - persistence.

note: because we do not have a database for our project we do not have a persitence layer
